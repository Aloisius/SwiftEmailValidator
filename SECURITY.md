## Reporting a Vulnerability

If security vulnerability is identified, please send an email to dave /@/ encoded.life with the details.

While this library is not expected to be updated often, if a security vulnerability is identified a priority 
update will be implemented. Due to the young age of this library, I thank you for testing this library
extensively before using it in business critical systems.
